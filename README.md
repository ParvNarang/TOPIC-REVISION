# TOPIC-REVISION
Topic Revision using Python.
In this project it asks the user which topic he/she wants to revise for the exam. This includes speech to text conversion using speech_recognition library and plays the necessary sounds loaded in the device using the playsound library. After the topic is revised, the user can also ask some doubts related to the topic from the device. Initially it is having 2 chapters and a separate quiz round for the chapters.
# Future Plan
Integrate the device with RaspberryPI in a box loaded with a few more chapters.
